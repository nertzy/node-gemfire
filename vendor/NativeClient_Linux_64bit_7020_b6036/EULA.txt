case of Pivotal's willful misconduct, fraud or gross negligence, and where a 
limitation of liability is not permissible under applicable mandatory law, 
Pivotal shall be liable according to statutory law.
B. Subject always to subsection 9.3.A, the liability of Pivotal (including 
its suppliers) to the Customer under or in connection with a Customer's 
purchase order, whether arising from negligent error or omission, breach of 
contract, or otherwise ("Defaults") shall not exceed the lesser of (i) fees 
You paid for the Software during the 12 months preceding Pivotal's notice of 
such claim; or (ii) or one million euros (€1,000,000).

could arise. For the purposes of this Section 9.3, the term "loss" shall 
include a partial loss, as well as a complete or total loss.		
	
D. The parties expressly agree that should any limitation or provision 
contained in this Section 9.3 be held to be invalid under any applicable 
statute or rule of law, it shall to that extent be deemed omitted, but if any 
party thereby becomes liable for loss or damage which would otherwise have 
been excluded such liability shall be subject to the other limitations and 
provisions set out in this Section 9.3.
E. The parties expressly agree that any order for specific performance made 
in connection with this EULA in respect of Pivotal shall be subject to the 
financial limitations set out in sub-section 9.3.B.

of the EULA the Customer shall: 
1) from a point in time prior to the point of failure, (i) make full and/or 
incremental backups of data which allow recovery in an application consistent 
form, and (ii) store such back-ups at an off-site location sufficiently 
distant to avoid being impacted by the event(s) (e.g. including but not 
limited to flood, fire, power loss, denial of access or air crash) and affect 
the availability of data at the impacted site;
2) have adequate processes and procedures in place to restore data back to a 
point in time and prior to point of failure, and in the event of real or 
perceived data loss, provide the skills/backup and outage windows to restore

levels are kept to Pivotal recommended versions and that any proposed changes 
thereto shall be communicated to Pivotal in a timely fashion.
